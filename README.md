# LeetCode Solution in Python

## Note:
1. LeetCode Solutions are written in Python. One question may have several approaches to solve. Only the best solution implemented (with the best time complexity) are not commented. Others are commented for reference. (Some complex solution with much faster time may not be implemented.)
2. There are some solutions written in C. Those may not be the optimal solutions.
